# Decision Tree Implementation: Diabetes Prediction

This repository provides a Python implementation of a decision tree classifier to predict diabetes based on patient data.

## Purpose

- Predicts the presence of diabetes in patients based on various health metrics.
- Demonstrates the application of decision tree algorithms for medical classification tasks.
- Provides insights into feature importance and decision-making processes.

## Implementation

- Uses Python's `scikit-learn` library to build and evaluate the decision tree model.
- Employs `pandas` for data loading and manipulation.
- Visualizes the decision tree using `matplotlib` and `graphviz`.
- Includes functionality for evaluating model performance with metrics such as accuracy.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib graphviz` (and Graphviz system installation if necessary).
2. Place your diabetes data in `Diabetes_D4.xlsx` (or modify the script to read from your data source).
3. Run the provided Jupyter notebook (`Decsion Tree_Diabetes.ipynb`).
4. Interpret output:
    - The notebook will display the decision tree visualization.
    - It will also print the accuracy score of the model.
    - The output will give you an idea of the tree's complexity.

## Key Concepts

- **Decision Tree:** A tree-like model that makes predictions by following decision rules derived from the data.
- **Feature Importance:** Measures the contribution of each feature to the prediction accuracy.
- **Classification Metrics:** Measures the performance of the classification model (accuracy).

## Output

- Visualized decision tree.
- Accuracy score.
- Information about the parameters used to build the tree.
